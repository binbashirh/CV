    <h1>Types of web developers<br></h1>
    <p>There are different types of web developers who focus on different areas. These include:<br></p>
    <p><em><strong>Frontend developers</strong>: </em> Frontend developers implement web page designs using HTML and CSS. They make sure the website looks pretty on different devices, and that the forms and buttons work.<br></p>
    <p><em><strong>Backend developers</strong>: </em>Backend developers create the backbone of the web application. They write code logic that handles a user’s input (for example, what should happen when you click the signup button after filling in a form).</p>
    <p><em><strong>Full Stack</em></strong>: Full stack developers do bits of both backend and frontend. Depending on the problem at hand, they can switch cape 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️ and move stacks. You can learn more about the differences between frontend and backend development in this guide.</p>
